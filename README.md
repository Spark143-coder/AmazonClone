    Navigation bar with logo, search bar, and cart

    Location/address bar

    Product shop sections

    Footer with multiple panels

    Hero image banner

    Note: This is only a frontend UI model and does not include backend functionality like login, product search, or cart management.

🛠️ Technologies Used
